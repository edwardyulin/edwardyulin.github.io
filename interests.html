          <div class="sports_desc">
              <p>During my spare time, I like to exercise and play sports during my spare time. Baseball is my favourite sport!  
                  I was on my highschool baseball team. I have also been playing table tennis and soccer since 9 years old. I got 4th place 
                  in a table tennis tournament held in Ontario when I was in highschool and qualified until top 16 in a tournament 
                  hosted by UBC with players from all over British Columbia province. I also like to jog sometimes when I am stressed 
                  because it helps me to focus on my breathing and forget about my problems even just briefly.  </p>

          <div class="travel_desc">
            <p>I enjoy traveling to different places and chat with local people to gain more perspectives about the world. 
            I have been to numerous countries, including England, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Dominican Republic, 
            Venezuela, and Puerto Rico. I have also travelled to all of the provinces on the East Cost of Canada (Quebec 
            and the Maritimes). I am also  no stranger to the United States, I have also travelled to many states in the 
            USA. My most recent trip is to Green Island (綠島) in Taiwan. A graduation trip that I planned for myself to 
            embrace my achievement of successfully finishing my undergraduate career. </p>

          <h2>Networking</h2>
          <div class="networking_desc">
            <p>I have been a part of few student-run clubs at UBC as I believe this will help me to broaden
              my friend circle by finding friends with similar interests or cultural backgrounds. As an executive and and
              an active member of New Taiwanese Generations, a student-run social club made up by mostly Taiwanese 
              students that grew up in Canada (like myself), I have participated in numerous social events to meet people I 
              can culturally connect with and took on the leadership role to plan countless networking events.
              I am also very active within the expo/conference community as I believe participating in these events help to me 
              to expand my horizon in fields I relate to and meet people I can strongly connect with. </p>
