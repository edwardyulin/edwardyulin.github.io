            <p> <br>Welcome! I am a fourth year UBC (University of British Columbia) student majoring in Cognitive Sciences, <br>
                primarily focusing on the study of Computer Science and Psychology. I was born in Taiwan in 1999 <br>
                (21 years old now!) and moved to Canada in the summer of 2011. Hence, I am bilingual and fluent in both <br>
                English and Mandarin. I enjoy meeting new people and attending events although I am be shy at first but I <br>
                am actually really outgoing! I have experience coding in various of computational languages: Java, Python, C++, <br>
                HTML, and many more! If you wish to learn more about me feel free to click through my site! <br></p>
